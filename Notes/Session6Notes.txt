Class 

Person{

Fill it in with Strings and int

ex.

int age;
String name;
int height;
int weight;
String nickname;


}

How can we use this data type in our program?. Remember again how you are used to declare a basic Java supplied variable, which is datatype followed by variable.(int age;) Here also same.

Person person1;

Here the data type is Person and variable is person1

We have slight difference in assigning values to this variable. In regular data type like int you have used = 10 ( justed used = and then value). But for the data types you have created

Person person1 = new Person();

= new datatype();

new is the keyword and you are saying to Java that I want to create new value ( the technical term object which we will learn more about this in the next class) for this data type I have created. Once you have done this, then you can assign individual parts of Person (age,name,grade,height,weight) using . (dot) like below

    Person person1 = new Person();
    person1.age = 14;
    person1.name = “Sahil”;
    person1.grade = 9;
    person1.height = 5;
    person1.weight = 100;
